Kind of like the Spotify wrapped experience, but for your Facebook data

## TODO
* [x] Location history data plotting
* [ ] Message data visualisation
    * [ ] Efficient data parsing
    * [ ] Extract useful data and plot it e.g:
        * [ ] Total messages for each user (bar chart - sent vs received)
        * [x] Message frequency over time (globally, and for single users)
* [ ] Automatic detection of useful folders straight from download
* [ ] Local dashboard/webapp
* [ ] Interactive UI/commandline utility
